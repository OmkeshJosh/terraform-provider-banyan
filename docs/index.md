# Banyan Terraform Provider

Banyan replaces your traditional network access boxes – VPNs, bastion hosts, and gateways – with a cloud-based zero trust access solution.

The Banyan Terraform provider is used for lifecycle management management of Banyan resources including Roles, Policies, and Services. Learn more about Banyan [here.](https://www.banyansecurity.io/)

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

To learn the basics of the Banyan components, check out the documentation [here.](https://docs.banyanops.com/)

For example usage of the Banyan Terraform provider, please check out the [getting started tutorial.]() #TODO: add this link
