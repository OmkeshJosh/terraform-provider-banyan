# banyan_service (Resource)

The banyan_service resource is used to manage Banyan services. The service resource is the core configuration resource in the Banyan Command Center. For more information on services, please see the documentation [here.](https://docs.banyanops.com/docs/intro/concepts/services/)

In the current API implementation, each service type uses a specific combination of keys in the service resource. This will be abstracted away in a future release in order to reduce complexity. Please see the following implementations of each service type:
* [Web Service](#web-service)
* [SSH Service](#ssh-service)
* [RDP Service](#rdp-service)
* [Database Service](#database-service)
* [Kubernetes Service](#k8s-service)
* [TCP Service](#tcp-service)

								The names in this list are allowed to start with the wildcard character "*" to match more
								than one backend name. This field is used generally with HttpConnect=FALSE. For all HttpConnect=TRUE cases, or where 
								more advanced backend defining patterns are required, use BackendAllowPatterns.
